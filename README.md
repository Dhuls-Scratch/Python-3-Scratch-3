This is a project that uses Python 3 to communicate with the Scratch 3.0 cloud server.
Using this requires a Scratch Account with the Scratcher status. It also requires Python 3.9 (I used 3.9.5, but switched to 3.9.6) and the Python module
scratchclient can be installed by running this command in a terminal "pip install scratchclient" Note that Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are required (at least on Windows)

Scratch is available at https://scratch.mit.edu

Scratchclient Documentation is available at https://github.com/CubeyTheCube/scratchclient/wiki
