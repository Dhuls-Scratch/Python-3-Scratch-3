To use this yourself you need to share your own project on the Scratch Website and modify the backend (Python) code. To test:
1. Create a new Scratch Project
2. Upload the Front End (Scratch) code
3. Recreate the cloud variables. There's an issue where importing cloud vars causes them to turn into normal vars.
4. Get it's Project ID (it should be the last part of the URL, like in https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123456 the ID is 123456)
5. Load up the Back End (Python) code in your IDE/editor
6. Replace the undefined variables (they are all pretty self explanatory). Make sure you are using a different account from the one that owns the project.
7. Alternatively, define them.
8. Run the Scratch Project, then the Python Project. You should be able to see the variable changing on both ends, and when it equals a subset of HTTP status codes (there were too many) Sprite1 will say them.
